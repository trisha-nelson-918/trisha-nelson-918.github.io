    <h1> My Dance Journey </h1>
    <main>
        <p>Growing up, I tried nearly every sport on the planet and was not talented in any of them. I spent a number of soccer seasons without scoring a goal, an entire basketball season only making one shot. But then, I found out about dance through one of my friends who raved about it. After months of begging my mom, she finally let me join a class and I instantly felt like that's where I always belonged. I've always had a connection to music - I played multiple instruments growing up - and everything about it felt natural. Flash forward 10 years and countless recitals and competitions later, here I am still dancing! Below is a list of all the styles I am currently trained in / actively practicing:</p>
    </main>
        <ul> 
            <li> contemporary </li>
            <li> hip hop </li>
            <li> jazz </li>
            <li> ballet </li>
            <li> tap </li>
        </ul> 
<body>
        </main> 
            <p> Despite all my formal training, I'm always exploring new avenues to express my love for dance. In my free time, I like to choreograph dances using techniques from my favorite styles. I am currently working on a jazz piece to my favorite song by Alicia Keys! Our group will be preforming it at our bi-annual showcase this April on the 20th. Additionally, for the first time in my life, I have learned different forms of Indian dance which has been a difficult but extremely rewarding journey. I am also in another preformance for the South Asian organization on March 16th, which is so soon! </p>
